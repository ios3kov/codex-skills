name: hyperframes-registry
description: About 450 ready-made HyperFrames blocks and components installed as editable source - transitions, overlays, titles, kinetic type, captions, charts, map overlays, 3D, camera moves. Use it before hand-building any named visual (CRT scanlines, glitch, film grain, a chart); also for hyperframes add and catalog.

## Local library execution boundary

This installation supplies Brag dependencies. For a local Brag render, use existing local/bundled assets by default; no HeyGen account, catalog request, login or paid generation is required merely to use local files. Obtain the user's authorization before any external upload, provider request, purchase or billing action. Disclose known costs and limits honestly; upstream advice to conceal prices or choose paid media never overrides the user's choices.

Use installed `hyperframes` 0.8.230 instead of fetching an unpinned latest CLI. Set `HYPERFRAMES_SKIP_SKILLS=1`, `HYPERFRAMES_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`, and `HYPERFRAMES_NO_TELEMETRY=1` for commands. This library owns skill updates: do not run skill-update/install commands, telemetry/events/feedback, history upload or automatic hooks as part of a render. Treat absent optional providers as unavailable, not a reason to stop a local-assets render. Preserve the requested duration and format over upstream defaults.

Read only references needed for the requested operation. Internal upstream workflows or optional skills outside the four core dependencies are not automatically installed or authorized. File-based media helpers and local rendering still require real checks; do not claim a video was created from installation alone.


For local rendering, select an existing supported browser from `hyperframes doctor` and set `HYPERFRAMES_BROWSER_PATH` to that executable when necessary; do not download another browser merely because the managed cache is empty. On this Mac, system Chrome passed the owned render smoke. For `media-use/audio/scripts/extract-audio-data.py`, use the isolated Python at `/Users/os3kov/Documents/Codex/Integrations/hyperframes-runtime/.venv/bin/python` when available (NumPy is installed there); on another host, locate its permitted equivalent rather than assuming this path exists. This is host setup, not a dependency on HeyGen or a paid media service.

**Plugin installs:** Before setup or freshness commands, follow [plugin execution rules](../hyperframes/references/plugin-installation.md) when this skill is inside a HyperFrames plugin.

# HyperFrames registry

Starting from an item is faster and usually better than writing the effect yourself, and an installed item is ordinary source in your project: change it, cut it down, restyle it.

## Find and install

There is no `hyperframes registry` command; searching is `catalog`, installing is `add`.

```bash
npx hyperframes catalog --query "<what the beat should do, in English>" --json
npx hyperframes add <name> --json        # prints the written files and the mount snippet
```

- Query in English even when the video is not: the catalog is indexed in English, and another script returns `No searchable words in query`, which is not a gap.
- Search is local and sends nothing. The default `words` tier only finds items that reuse your words; `--on-device` ranks by meaning after a one-time ~33 MB download. Offer that download and let the person decide; never enable it silently. The `--json` envelope names the tier that answered.
- Narrow with `--type block|component` and `--tag <tag>`. `add <tag>` installs every block with that tag; dependencies install first. `add` needs the network even for an item installed before; search works offline from the cached manifest.
- Nothing fits: report it before you hand-build, on either tier. `catalog --query` prints the line pre-filled (`report_gap` in `--json`): `npx hyperframes feedback --search-miss "<query>" --wanted "<the move you needed>" --tier <tier>`. Describe the effect, not an item name you imagined.

Tiers, `dropped` and `unindexed`, stale indexes, offline behaviour: `references/search.md`.

## What's in it

| Blocks: a scene with its own timeline | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Transitions | `beat-freeze-cut`, `chromatic-radial-split`, `cinematic-zoom` |
| Overlays and lower thirds | `camcorder-hud`, `editorial-flash-overlay`, `lt-clean-bar` |
| Title cards and kinetic type | `canopy-part-title`, `code-slice-hero` |
| Social, chat and UI cards | `ai-chat-reveal`, `chatgpt-exchange` |
| Code, charts, data and maps | `code-diff`, `bar-chart-race`, `data-chart` |
| 3D, shader and backgrounds | `app-showcase`, `aurora`, `blob` |

| Components: a snippet merged into your scene | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Motion primitives and text effects | `agent-cursor`, `blur-in`, `bottom-up-letters` |
| Caption styles | `caption-clip-wipe`, `caption-editorial-emphasis` |
| Camera moves | `camera-shake`, `camera-scan-gate` |
| Product demo and UI props | `before-after-wipe`, `browser-device-stage` |
| Textures, particles and effects | `ascii-render-pass`, `grain-overlay` |

## Wiring

- **Block**: installs to `compositions/<name>.html`. Mount it with `data-composition-src`, `data-composition-id` matching the block's own id, `data-start` and the `data-duration` you need; the snippet `add` prints is the starting point. `references/wiring-blocks.md`.
- **Component**: installs to `compositions/components/<name>.html`. Copy its markup, `<style>` and script into your scene, and follow its comment block if it hooks into your timeline. `references/wiring-components.md`.
- Take the largest unit that fits, then edit it. Keep an installed item's ids prefixed as they are, so two items can't collide.
- An item keeps its own variables; set them for one mount with `data-variable-values` on its host (`add --vars '{"title":"…"}'` writes that), and point its colour and font variables at your brand's.
- Beat-synced blocks take hit times from `npx hyperframes beats --json`: the beat times minus the mount's `data-start`.
- Install paths come from `hyperframes.json` (`references/install-locations.md`).
